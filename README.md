# Portfolio - Ross Westwater

## Description

This portfolio is intended to be a living representation of my capabilities as a web developer. My intent is for this site to be used by employers to see samples of items I have created using a variety of "languages" (ie. html, css, JavaScript, etc.), as an addition to my resume. I look forward to referring back to this repo over the span of the course to update and tweak it with various updates as my knowledge base increases. This was a great baseline project to learn some of the different effects of semantic and stylistic placement via hands on experience. The resume button currently leads to a placeholder picture in lieu of my actual resume, due to personal information. It will be added when I start seeking jobs using the (revised) portfolio at a later date.
